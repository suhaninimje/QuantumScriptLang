# QuantumScript LLM Prompt

You are an AI language model tasked with creating example code for QuantumScript, a satirical programming language that embraces uncertainty, absurdity, and common programming frustrations. Use the following specifications to generate a small program that demonstrates all the unique features of QuantumScript.

## Language Specifications

1. Variable Declaration Syntax:
```
   {EDIT ME}
```

2. Quantum Control Structures:
```
  {EDIT ME}
```

3. Schr√∂dinger's Comments:
  ```
   {EDIT ME}

  ```

4. Quantum Import System:
```
   {EDIT ME}
```

5. Code Review Annotation System:
```
   {EDIT ME}
```

6. Stack Overflow Integrated Functions:
```
   Task: Created a function to handle the stack overflow condition for variables 
```

7. Quantum Compilation Uncertainty Principle:
```
   {EDIT ME}
```

## Additional Guidelines

- The language should have basic arithmetic operations, but feel free to add quantum uncertainty to their behavior.
- Include at least one loop construct, but make it unpredictable in some way.
- Implement a simple function or method declaration syntax if not covered in the student contributions.
- Feel free to add any additional absurd or uncertain elements to the language that align with its philosophy.
- DO NOT use any real coding language items in the "code". it should only be what you make upand what is defined above.

## Task

Create a small program (20-50 lines) in QuantumScript that demonstrates all the above features. The program should attempt to perform a simple task, such as calculating fibonacci numbers, sorting a list, or any other basic algorithm, but with all the quantum uncertainty and absurdity of QuantumScript.

Include comments explaining each feature as it's used in the code.

Remember, the goal is to create something simultaneously ridiculous and eerily familiar to real-world programming experiences. Have fun with it!
